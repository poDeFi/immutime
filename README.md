# ImmuTime

ImmuTime is an NFT watch collection backed by unique, physical automatic watches

The NFTs are not randomly generated, they represent a unique combination of watch parts assembled together.

A watch is defined by:

| Part                 | Example                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Case                 | SKX007, Nautilus...     |
| Dial                 | Divemaster, Explorer... |
| Hands                | Milsub, Mercedes        |
| Bezel                | Pilot, Submariner ...   |
| Strap                | Bracelet, NATO...       |
| Movement             | NH35A                   |
| See-through Caseback | Y/N                     |
