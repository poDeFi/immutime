# 0001 Modern Milsub

This is a more modern interpretation of a Rolex Milsub.

It's a Japanese domestic market SKX007 modded with:

- a NH35 movement for hacking and winding
- a vintage Rolex Submariner-like dial and bezel
- Milsub hands
- And a rubber dive strap

# Story

I built this watch in 2021 as I loved my original SKX007 but for some reason the movement stopped working after a few years of standard use.

Instead of throwing it away I decided to replace the movement.
I had previously heard of watch modding and thought that this could be a good opportunity to make some other customization.
The thing that I was missing from the original watch was the possibility to manually wind the watch and have it stop when adjusting the time (hacking). Though I liked the quirkiness of it, I really wanted to have those 2 features that are usually taken for granted.
Then, I loved the vintage submariner's look and the cleanliness of a ceramic bezel, so I swapped the standard bezel and bezel insert for a vintage sub one.

I messed up changing the hands to the "Mercedes" hands, standard on Rolex, but had some sword hands available, which are usually seen on Milsub, so I used them instead, and I liked the end result.

Finally, I had the watch on a NATO strap for a long time but also liked the rubber style, especially on a dive watch, so decided to switch to complete the mod.

So there you go, a vintage Submariner on a JDM SKX007 with Milsub hands.

I love wearing this watch, it's unique, I built it myself and know how to fix it, it has already travelled around the world (It has its fair share of scratches!) and I hope to be able to keep wearing it for many years to come!
